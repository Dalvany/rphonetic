[features]
#! There is two features that provide default rules and Default implementation for some struct.
#! They are not enabled by default as files are embedded into code, so it might increase binary size. Itâ€™s best to provide rules by your own.

## Beider-Morse rules. It includes only `any` language and other files that are required. All file can be found in
